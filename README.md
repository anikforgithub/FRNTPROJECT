💡 How It Works
When the page loads, the first question appears, and the timer starts counting down from 30 seconds.
Users select an answer by clicking on one of the multiple-choice options.
After each selection, the next question loads automatically.
Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the final score is shown.
The "Restart Quiz" button allows the user to retake the quiz.


📦 Customization
To add more questions, simply update the quizData array inside script.js:
const quizData = [
  {
    question: "New Question?",
    options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    answer: "Correct Option",
  }
];
